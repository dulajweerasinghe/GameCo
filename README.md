Key areas of focus and points in the dataset
A few key areas were highlighted with the objective to provide an analytical viewpoint for executives' sales requirements according to the video game sales dataset.
1. Analyse sales trends in three major regions and globally, identifying potential interactions.
2. Determine the proportion of each geographical area's contribution to global sales and allocate marketing budget accordingly.
3. Finally, how different regions geographical areas' proportions behaved over the last two decades.

I analysed these three elements and scattered periods of time to deliver useful insights.
